//    For stable and correct work of the application its working directory should contain
// folders /sql and /template with database and html-template files. Therefore it's highly
// recommended to compile the project into the root directory of the project.
//    In the root directory you can find a batch file, that will simplify the compilation
// process: compiler.bat
//    This file is created for your convenience and runs compilation command from the root:
// 		>>go build ./cmd/web	
//  
// This way you can be sure that executable file will find specified directories.
